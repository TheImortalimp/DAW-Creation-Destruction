For sharing and / or colaborating with and on DAW project files
All VST's will be pointed to the Location: "C:\Program Files\VstPlugins\" in the project files. 
[subfolders might be plugin names/named subfolders so just try use the plugins you get online as they are installed or by copying the file structure after unzipping}

Some links following to get you started!

this site offers the new 64bit (only) free version of Cakewalk Sonar!  
It is now called Cakewalk by Bandlab, simply make an account and look for the download app link to install it to your pc using the bandlab assistant.
(this is great free software with some free plugins to get you started)

REAPER is a versatile relatively cheap alternative for Digital Audio Creation, they offer a free trial for new users so check it out!
This DAW is now also 64bit only, though the plugin bridging from 32bit to 64bit for VST's is very good.
(you might get lost in the options and settings if you are more used to other DAW's , but definately give it a try, its pretty awesome)

I HOPE YOU DO GOOD MAKING NEW MUSIC.
